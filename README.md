-How do I approach designing software?
I go into deep analysis of what is the requirements and what is expected to gain a better understanding of what is needed to be done. It is best to then create a high-level architecture that outlines the components, their interactions, and data flows. Then to approach in components versus doing everything all at once, this will promote reusability, maintainability and ensure nothing is overlooked.
-What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
OpenGl is a brand new tool that I had to consume to assist me with this project, I learned in depth skills of shape building, lighting, shadows and creating a 3D landscape. With meshing everything I learned throughout these weeks I was able to create a landscape that allows movement, depth and emphasize my strength in computer graphics.
-What design process did you follow for your project work?
To design my project I wanted to create something that was familar to me which was a desk. I didnt have much tools to use so I had to go to a local store to then use what they had available to create my scene! It was a task for sure but very fun. I then began to build shapes I was used to and kept going from there.
-How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
With precision and perseverance, I know I can tackle any work placed in front of me. I do believe that my code will be reusable in future projects so I believe this would be a great reference point and something that can help me build off future work as well. My emphasis on my new skills will serve me well in future projects and the reusable codebase can not only save time but also to build upon and enhance the existing codebase.
-How do I approach developing programs?
After extensive requirement gathering and creating an umbrella overview of the design and layout of code. I then approach the software in components to take in the project in bite sizes. This assists me greatly without being overwhelmed and helps with consistent editing and catching mistakes early on versus at the very end and having to retrace my steps. This approach has assisted me greatly in this project.
-What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Utilizing the libraries effectively to assist me with expedited development was very helpful while working on my 3D scene and helped this project be carried forward to streamline development.
-How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was crucial in my software development. By consistently iterating my code, I believe it improved its quality, performance, and user experience. This approach helped to catch and rectify issues early on.
-How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I definitely learned from mistakes, and when made, revised and tried again. This not only optimized your development processes later on but also helped me tune my problem solving skills and naturally all mistakes were a part of my growth and will continue as you gain more experience.
-How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I know my goals in life and taking these courses and continuing my education journey will lead me to my success. I know that all hurdles I cross will get me to my next hurdle until the point I get to cross the finish line. I hope that after everything is said and done that I will be able to gain the position I hope for so then I can invest in my myself more heavily.
-How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Besides all the technical aptitude that is gained from computer graphics and in its developement, you do gain and get to build on your creativity skills with this and that is something others may overlook but can be invaluable. Creativity is paired with intuition and both can be a  powerful duo when faced with an obstacle that needs outside the box thinking to approach never came across issues.
